### Technology Used:
The EventEase Daily Planner utilizes a combination of CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Node JS, Expresss JS Frameworks, MongoDB, Mongoose, and OAuth Authentication. JavaScript included the various functionalities, such as updating, creating, and deleting tasks. EJS is a key component in rendering the JavaScript unto the page allowing for dynamic updates to the planner. 

MongoDB provides a database for information to be stored while OAuth Authentication allows for the user to sign in using a google account to access the planner. By using these technologies, the planner acheives seamless interactivity, an eye-easing interface, enhancing the overall experience for those using the EventEase Daily Planner.
